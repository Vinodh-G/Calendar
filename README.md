Hey Guys!

I am Vinodh Swamy, currently working in Vmware Inc as Mobile Engineer, responsible for development and deployment of iOS mobile apps, I have 7+ years of experience in iOS Mobile Technologies, good experience with iOS frameworks.

Coming towards my personal life, I play football, like to watch movies, reading blogs, lazy gym visitor :P 

My family includes my younger brother and sister along with my parents and that's it

I have made a quick demo of the given task in the link : https://1drv.ms/v/s!Ah5azTrF9kkpgWBfI6DJuSUZ5sSV have a look at if time permits.

Have not used any dummy events, used events from EKEventKit which was easier for me rather than creating dummy events, it would look good if we run the sample on the mobile rather than the simulator.

Thanks,
Vinodh
